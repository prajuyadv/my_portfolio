              Hey there 👋 I&rsquo;m <strong>Praju Kumar Yadav Patnam</strong> — a
              Mobile &amp; Full Stack Developer who speaks fluent React Native,
              negotiates with Node.js, and occasionally argues with TypeScript
              (but we always patch things up).
            </p>
            <p>
              With 4+ years of experience building cross-platform apps and
              scalable backend systems, I&rsquo;ve crafted everything from
              real-time chat apps to geofence-based attendance trackers. I love
              building apps that are fast, user-friendly, and can survive a
              production bug or two 😅.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&rsquo;ve worked with teams at Tru Equations and Capgemini IT
              Services and currently pursuing my Master&rsquo;s in Information
              Systems at Saint Louis University. Whether it&rsquo;s deploying
              APIs or animating UI transitions, I enjoy turning ideas into
              clean, functional code.
            </p>
            <p>When I&rsquo;m not coding, you&rsquo;ll probably find me:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <FaUtensils className="inline-block mr-2" /> Perfecting my
                biryani recipe (spicy enough to wake the neighbors)
              </li>
              <li>
                <FaHiking className="inline-block mr-2" /> Exploring new trails
                and pretending I didn&rsquo;t take a wrong turn
              </li>
              <li>
                <FaPuzzlePiece className="inline-block mr-2" /> Solving bugs
                that I may or may not have introduced myself
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I believe in writing code that&rsquo;s easy to read, fun to
              maintain, and built with purpose. Currently diving deeper into
              system design, real-time communication, and building flexible UI
              kits for better developer experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m passionate about lifelong learning and solving real-world
              problems with tech—bonus points if the UI looks good while doing
              it!
